    <!-- callback functions: -->

    <span><strong>Callback Function:</strong></span>
    <ul>
        <li>Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments in other functions. </li>
        <li>This technique allows a function to call another function</li>
        <li>A callback function can run after another(first) function has finished execution</li>
        <li>A callback is simply a piece of JavaScript that gets executed after something else has finished executing.</li>
        <li>When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use parenthesis.
            <br> Right: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);
            <br> Wrong: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer());</li>
    </ul>

    <span><strong>Callback hell or pyramid of doom</strong></span>
    <ul>
        <li> Callbacks provide a useful way to handle asynchronous operations. However, when many callbacks are nested, the code can be complex and hard to read and understand.</li>
        <li>This happens when you chain multiple callbacks together, one after the other, creating a pyramid - like structure of indentation called callback hell, also known as the "Pyramid of Doom".</li>

    </ul>
