    <p><strong>Synchronous programming:</strong> It is a way for computers to do things one step at a time, in the order they are given the instructions. </p>
    <h2>Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Asynchronous JavaScript code is something, which start at current interval and ends later.</p>
    <p>Asynchronous programming is a way for a computer program to handle multiple tasks simultaneously rather than executing them one after the other. </p>
    <p>Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous.</p>
    <p>Basically, JS is a synchronous language and single-threaded langauage.</p>
    <p>Single thereaded means javascript can only execute one command at a time.</p>
    <p>Synchronous Single thereaded means javascript can only execute one command at a time and in a specific order. It means that, it can only go to the next line once the current line finished execution.</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, asynchronous code can be written in a variety of different ways, including: 1. Callbacks 2. Promises 3. async/await

        <p>async-javascript-set-timeout setTimeout() accepts two arguments: A callback function that is executed asynchronously & The minimal number of milliseconds a program waits before executing the callback function.
        </p>
        <p>async-javascript-set-interval setInterval() accepts two arguments: A callback function that is executed asynchronously The number of milliseconds for how frequently the callback function executes
        </p>

    </p>
    <!-- Example 1: -->
    <p>The result of the calculation is:</p>

    <!-- setTimeout() with a Callback -->
    <h2>setTimeout() with a Callback</h2>

    <p>Wait 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds) for this page to change.</p>

    <h3>HTTP request: (Hypertext transfer protocol)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We make HTTP requests that can be used to send or receive data from a server side resource</li>
        <li>Data can be sent using the HTTP POST method and received using the HTTP GET method. </li>
        <li>HTTP requests in JavaScript are a set of predefined methods used for interacting with data stored on servers.</li>
        <li>Every request sent to a server includes an endpoint(URL) and the type of request being sent(GET, POST). </li>
        <li>You can see an endpoint as a gateway between two programsÀê the client and the server.</li>
        <li>The client is the program that sends a request while the server is the one that receives the request.</li>
        <li>The server sends back a response depending on the validity of the request.</li>
        <li>If the request is successful, the server sends back data in either XML or JSON format(JSON in most cases), and if the request fails, the server sends back an error message.</li>
    </ul>
