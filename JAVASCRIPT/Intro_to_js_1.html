    <h1>Getting started with Javascript:</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Javascript is a <strong>interpreted</strong> as well as <strong>case sensitive</strong> programming language.</li>
        <li> It can be used for both client-side as well as server-side developments.</li>
        <li>It is simply a synchronous single-threaded language.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Single-threaded means that javascript can only execute one command at a time. </li>
            <li>And Synchronous single-threaded means that javascript can only execute one command at a time and in a specific order. </li>
            <li>So that means that it can only go to the next line once the current line has been finished executing.</li>
            <li> Evolution of javascript: Created in 1995 by brendan Eich while he was working on Netscape.</li>
        </ul>


        <li>Comments:
            <p>1. Single line: // This is a Single line comment //
                <br> 2. Multiline: /* This is a Multiline comment */
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> How Javascript actually works:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>"Everything in Javascript happens inside an EXECUTION CONTEXT"</li>
        <li>When a Javascript code is executed, an Execution Context is created and it is called as Global Execution Context. </li>
        <li>Javascript program is executed in 2 phases inside the Execution Context...</li> <br>
        <ul>
            <li> MEMORY ALLOCATION PHASE:</li>
            <p>1. The browser initially scans the JS code and allocates memory for variables and functions defined in the program.</p>
            <p>2. So it is a sort of environment in which all these variables and functions are stored as key-value pairs. </p>

            <li>CODE EXECUTION PHASE:</li>
            <p>1. This is the place where code is executed one line by line at a time.</p>
            <p>2. Javascript is interpreted line by line and the code is executed </p>
        </ul>
    </ul>
   
    <!-- Internal JS -->
    <button onclick="alert('Hello Javascript : This is inline JS');">Click to render inline JS</button>
    <br><br>

    <!-- External JS -->
    <button type="button" id="helloJs">Click to render External JS</button>
    <script src="Intro_to_js_1.js"></script>

    <hr>
    <!-- Embedded JS -->
    <script>
        var greetings = "welcome to javascript class: Embedded/Internal Js";
        var age = 21;
        var isstudent = false;
        document.write(greetings);
    </script>

    <!-- Variables -->
    <script>
        // Declaring Variable //
        var isEmployee;

        // Assigning values to variable //
        isEmployee = true;

        // Declaring Multiple variables //
        var greetings = "hello!",
            age = 21,
            isstudent = true;
